Hello,

This tutorial is mean to help you understanding how to use the dim-blink.

The functionality of this toy is divided in the four buttons it
contains. First, button one (S1) will allow you to switch the light that is on from
the regular state of green on to red on as you still push the
button. Secondly, the second button (S2) will allow you to turn on both
lights. Thirdly, the second to last button (S3) will allow you to turn off all
lights. The last button, S4, will allow you to run for two seconds a series of
sounds in different frequencies, concurrently, the lights will turn to the
opposite state every 50 miliseconds, regardless of their previous state. This
means the execution does not initialize to state but rather works with the
combination of lights that you leave before pressing button 4.  

Have fun! :)
