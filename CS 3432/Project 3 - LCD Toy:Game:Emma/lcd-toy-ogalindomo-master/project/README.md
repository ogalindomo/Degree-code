Welcome to the game Emma against the universe!

The purpose of this game is to test your guessing skills, as well as your
luck. To win this game you will have to guess 20 times in a row
which of the four buttons to press. If one is pressed incorrectly you will
loose. If it happes that you loose press any button and the game should
re-start.

Some indications about the screen. The screen contains a field from which Emma
can not escape, you will see if you are lucky enough! Also, when Emma is not
playing it will slowly change colors, if the game has started Emma will change
colors quickly.

On the lower-left hand corner of the screen there is "W:" which indicates how
many times you guessed correctly. Next, to the immediate right of the wins
counter there is an "X: " and "Y: " pattern. This is just for showing position
do not believe for a second that this is related to the movement
random choice made by the program. Time, time is the key. On top of the screen you will find an
indication of what to do. Essentially, "Guess N(orth), E(ast), W(est),
S(outh)".

Finally, the buttons below the screen work in the following way. S1 moves Emma
East, Left. S2 moves Emma South, Down. S3 moves Emma North, Up. S4 moves Emma
West, Right. Enjoy the game, and if you win, please feel special!
