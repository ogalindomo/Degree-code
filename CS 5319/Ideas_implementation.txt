For this system, we will start by identifying the dependency structure between words using the known pool of dependencies that are defined in the Universal Dependency Relations Version 2 document. After identifying such relation on a word basis, we would create a bag of words for every class and obtain the corresponding embeddings for each word in it. Given all the embeddings for each class, we will calculate the centroid of each bag of words to define where the words of that class stand in a hyperdimensional space. After doing so we would build a matrix of the 37 classes (rows) by their centroid's 50 features (obtained from the embeddings of  Glove). Using this array as our training data, we would map this data to our output (0-1 binary choice). With this,  we would be able to produce our positive and negative tags on the data (We would assume that 0.5 is positive, and less than 0.5 is negative.
